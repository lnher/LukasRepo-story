Morrowood was never a happy town. It was always muggy and the rain never stopped.
The clouds were always overhead like an endless sea of white, but it was home. 
More specifically it was the home Danny's parents had chosen for them.
Danny tried everything he could. He cried, he begged, he screamed and he even 
tried to runaway, but none of them worked. His parents was so determined to 
stay in Morroword.In an act of desperation, Danny decided to sabotage everything
in Morrowood. Hopefully, he and his family would be forced to leave town.

Unfortunately for Danny, as he was putting the finishing touches on his 
destructive venture, he was spotted by the town police and taken into custody. 
After a brief detainment and a prolonged scolding from his parents, he was 
released and placed on probation, and so faced a much harsher punishment if he
stepped out of line again. Forlorn and angry, Danny began planning his next 
move.
