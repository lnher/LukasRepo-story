Once upon a time there was a mom.
Her name was Mrs. Pteranodon.
Sitting on her nest she heard a crack and said "Oh boy my eggs are hatching!"
One by one her kids popped free.
Baby pteranodons one, two, three!
"I'll name you Tiny, Shiny, and Dawn!"
But Tiny said, "Wait, there's one more Mom!"
The last little creature was a different size,
with teeth a tail and big green eyes.
He didn't look anything like the rest!
"What am I doing in a pteranodon nest?"
